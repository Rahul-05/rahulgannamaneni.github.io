                <p class="rmund">
                    Our project vision is to create a solution that helps <span class="mainb">delivery drivers navigate
                        safely and efficiently on their routes</span>, while also benefiting a <span class="mainb">wider
                        user base</span>. We recognize the risks that delivery drivers face while on the road, including
                    <span class="mainub">traffic accidents, pedestrian incidents, and other hazards</span>. These risks
                    not only threaten the safety of the drivers themselves, but also the safety of pedestrians and other
                    road users.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To address these issues, <span class="mainb">we will be using a user-centered design methodology and
                        product development approach.</span> This means that we will be working closely with delivery
                    drivers to understand their needs and challenges, and using this information to inform the design
                    and development of our solution. We will also consider the needs and preferences of other user
                    groups, and ensure that our solution is easy to use and understand for a wide range of users.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our solution will leverage the latest technology, such as maps and navigation apps on smartphones,
                    to help delivery drivers plan and execute their routes safely and efficiently. We will also consider
                    other factors that can impact driver safety, such as weather conditions and construction updates,
                    and incorporate these into our solution. <span class="mainb">By making our solution widely available
                        and easy to use, we hope to improve the safety and efficiency of transportation for
                        everyone,</span> while also reducing the risk of accidents and incidents on the road.

                    To ensure the success of our smart helmet project, we adopted a goal-directed design approach that allowed us to move smoothly through the design process. We relied heavily on qualitative research methods, such as user interviews and usability testing sessions, to gather insights and inform our design decisions. We also established a strong foundation for the project by asking some key internal questions at the kickoff stage. This included researching lectures and other relevant information to better understand the needs of our target users and identify potential challenges and opportunities.

                <p class="rmund">
                    In order to understand the competitive landscape for our smart helmet, I conducted a competitive
                    analysis to evaluate the features and capabilities of other navigation tools on the market. Through
                    user surveys and interviews, I identified key features that were important to our target users, such
                    as convenience, safety, and reliability.
                    <br> <br>
                    I found that only a few of our competitors offered smart helmets features such as projection
                    technology and integrated navigation. However, many of these helmets devices lacked advanced
                    features or had limited functionality. Some helmets devices were also difficult to use or had
                    complex controls, which could be frustrating for users.
                    <br> <br>
                    In contrast, our smart helmet aims to capitalize on these weaknesses by offering a user-friendly
                    interface and advanced features such as real-time traffic updates and voice control. By offering a
                    more convenient and efficient way to navigate, our helmet aims to meet the needs of users who value
                    safety and reliability on the road.

                    analyzing user needs and preferences, I was able to narrow down the features that were crucial for
                    meeting the goals of our users and those that could be added or enhanced later on.

                <p class="rmund">
                    One of the key vision issues that we considered when designing the projection system for our smart
                    helmet was the potential for distraction. We wanted to ensure that the projections were clear and
                    easy to follow, but also minimized the risk of distracting the user from the road. To address this
                    issue, we carefully considered the placement of the projections within the helmet, aiming for a
                    position that was easy to see but not obtrusive.

                <p class="rmund">

                    In addition to the projections on the helmet visor, we also plan to incorporate a strip of subtle
                    light that fluctuates towards the required direction of travel. This additional navigation cue is
                    intended to provide users with an additional layer of guidance, helping them to stay on track and
                    navigate to their destination with confidence. The strip of light will be located on the helmet
                    itself, either along the bottom or the side, and will be designed to be unobtrusive and subtle. It
                    will
                    only be activated when the user is following a specific route, and will fluctuate in intensity and
                    direction to indicate the required turns and movements. By providing these projections and subtle
                    lighting cues, we hope to create a user-friendly and intuitive navigation experience that helps
                    users reach their destinations safely and efficiently.

                    Working through these sketches also helped us to spark more in-depth discussions and conversations

                    their experiences, including any challenges or issues they encountered.

                    <br>
                    • Explain the concept behind the app to the users
                    <br>
                    • Ask them to perform benchmark tasks one by one

                    <br>
                    • Analyse testing findings to find patterns within data
                    <br>
                    • Iterate designs based on new insights
                    <br> <br>
                    After analyzing the results of the study, we found that participants generally had a positive
                    experience with the prototype. They were able to navigate and use the helmet and app with ease, and
                    the feedback we received helped us identify areas for improvement.
                    Based on these insights, we plan to iterate on the design of the helmet and app to further enhance
                    the user experience.

                <h1 class="lmund">Layout</h1>
                <p class="rmund">
                    One of the important considerations when designing the layout and functionality of a mobile app is
                    ensuring that it is easy to use and accessible for users with different hand preferences. Some users
                    may be more comfortable using their right hand to operate their device, while others may prefer
                    their left hand.
                    <br> <br>
                    To accommodate these differences, we plan to incorporate options for both right-handed and
                    left-handed users in our mobile app. This may involve adjusting the position and layout of different
                    buttons and controls to make them more easily accessible for users with different hand preferences.
                    <br> <br>
                    For example, we may need to change the position of the "SOS" button or the Bluetooth connection icon
                    to make them more easily reachable for users with different hand preferences. We may also need to
                    consider adjusting the layout of the app to make it easier for users to access different features
                    and options, regardless of whether they are using their right or left hand.

                    In addition to considering the hand preferences of users when designing the layout of our mobile
                    app, it is also important to consider the importance and frequency of use of different buttons and
                    controls. This can help us determine the optimal position for these elements to ensure that they are
                    easy to access and use.

                <p class="rmund">

                    The smart helmet was designed and developed in a series of stages. First, the overall shape and size
                    of the helmet was determined, along with the placement of the various electronic components. Next,
                    the ESP32 microcontroller, accelerometer, OLED and HUD displays, and other electronic components
                    were chosen and connected to the helmet using wiring and soldering.

                <p class="rmund">

                    The ESP32 was programmed using a programming language such as Arduino C/C++ to control the helmet's
                    functions. This included code to control the projection and Bluetooth connection, detect accidents
                    using the accelerometer, and display information on the OLED and HUD displays.

                    A problem of mirror projection on the HUD display was encountered during development. This was
                    solved through the use of software correction, which involved adjusting the orientation of the
                    projection or applying a correction algorithm to the displayed image.

                            food delivery partners and daily users. The risks and challenges that these individuals face
                            while navigating on the road can be significant, and we believe that our helmet and
                            accompanying app can help reduce these risks and improve the overall experience of traveling
                            by two-wheeler.
                            <br> <br>
                            One of the primary difficulties we faced while designing the helmet was the challenge of
                            creating a projection system that could display useful information consistently and reliably
                            throughout the day. We wanted to ensure that our helmet could be used by a wide range of
                            users and in a variety of situations, which required us to think carefully about the size,
                            placement, and functionality of the projections.

                            road. We are confident that our smart helmet will be a valuable tool for both food delivery
                            partners and daily users, and we look forward to continuing to improve and enhance the user
                            experience as we move forward with development.

                            To achieve this, we plan to conduct additional user testing and evaluations to gather more
                            detailed insights about the user experience and identify areas for improvement. This will
                            involve using a variety of methods such as task-based usability studies, focus groups, and
                            surveys to gather feedback from users and understand their needs and preferences.
