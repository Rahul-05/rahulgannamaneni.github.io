                <p class="rmund">
                    Every year, around 10 million new ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) cases arise. ADHD
                    is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed
                    in childhood and often lasts into adulthood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, ADHD doesn't affect a child's knowledge or creativity. But ADHD can affect a student's
                    ability to focus, pay attention, listen, or put effort into schoolwork. ADHD also can make a student
                    fidgety, restless, talk too much, or disrupt the class. Kids with ADHD might also have learning
                    disabilities that cause them to have problems in school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As an ADHD child, the biggest hurdle is to do work in proper order and schedule tasks. This is where
                    parents come in and help them get over ADHD. But parents can't be there for a child in every case.
                    And also ADHD children should be able to plan their own tasks eventually after a certain age. But
                    this transition gets very hard for an ADHD child to cope up with.

                        striving for support.<br>
                        3. This user group confirmed initial assumptions about the Space app, but research also revealed
                        people are expecting to have better features that will encourage the child even when parents are

                        task
                        when the reward is to be given by parents because parents easily bend towards children if they

                            situation will regain their stability. So a mini-game is designed to show up at a time when

                            child is not able to complete the task on time. The game is designed in such a way that if a
                            child misses his deadline the game is pretty easy to regain his confidence and if he
                            completes
                            the tasks on time the game gets challenging. </p>
