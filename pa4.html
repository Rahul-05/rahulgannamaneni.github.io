                <p class="rmund">
                    Google maps are the most popularly used maps app with it also being supplied as default maps for
                    android phones. User groups who don't drive but travel frequently using public transport or cab or
                    not been recognized as maps users but users are using maps even in the back seat by using it as
                    default destination router to track their visit from the back seat to not miss their stop just by
                    muting the voice for directions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, It's only used by some people who realized it can be used like that but others dint find
                    the purpose to see maps like that so our task is to make this currently used unofficial feature into
                    a fully functional feature with consistent user flow to make new users get better usage of this
                    feature.

                <div class="rmund">
                    <p class="undbottom">1. I conducted interviews with 24 invidual(20 Frequent travelers(Public
                        transport) and 4 Students) and
                        created empathy maps to understand the users.<br>
                        2. Primary user groups mentioned that they frequently miss there stop when they use public
                        transport.<br>
                        3. This user group confirmed initial assumptions about the Maps app, but research also revealed
                        people never thought a maps as use when they are not the person driving.<br>
                        4. Students use public transport frequently to travel to college or any other fests but they
                        mentioned that the problem of missing destination is subtle but some used a means of contacting
                        driver to mention them when they specifically reached their destination but it dint work every
                        time. <br>
                        5. Other user groups identified are emergency travel like doctors or nurses to reach their
                        destination who mentioned they concentrate on contact with a doctor at the site, so they may
                        miss their stop. <br>
                        6. Women users across the globe are not allowed to travel at night even it is necessary due to
                        safety issues.
